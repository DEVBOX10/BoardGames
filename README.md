# BoardGames

Live version of this app: https://boardgames.alexyakunin.com/

"Board Games" is the new [Fusion] sample and a functional 
web app allowing you to play real-time multi-player board 
(or board-like) games.

The sample implements a number of features that are 
hard to implement without Fusion. In particular, you might notice
that real-time state sync works literally everywhere in it. 
Try opening the sample in two different browsers, sign in using 
different user accounts, and:
- Create and play a game in both windows
- Check out what happens with game lists when you're
  creating a game, making moves, or posting a chat message
- Try renaming your user & see its name changes everywhere - 
  even in chat mentions!
  
The sample currently implements:
- One game (Gomoku) - for now. I plan to add a couple more 
  a bit later - there is a common base API allowing to
  add new games with ease
- Game lobby, where you can track the state of games you
  participate in, browse open games created by other users 
  and join them
- Game chat, which supports mentions. In reality, there is
  an extendable message parser and modular renderer that 
  supports user and game mentions.
- User online/offline status tracking. Notice that every 
  user badge displays it.
- User profile page, where you can edit your user name, add 
  MS/GitHub accounts, see all browser sessions, "kick" some
  of them or sign out from all of them.
- Web API - it's used when the sample works in Blazor 
  WASM mode, so whatever UI can do is available there too.

Finally, the sample supports both both Blazor Server and 
Blazor WebAssembly modes.

The [live version] of this app is hosted on Google Cloud:
- Cloud Run runs its Docker image in 1-core/512MB RAM container
- Cloud PostgreSql stores the data; it also runs on
  the cheapest 1 core/3.75GB RAM host.

The most interesting part? **Everything you see here
was built by a single person in just 9 days.**
[The very first commit](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion.Samples/commit/546ae7597bc7fa3a0b3c7f3b84e3a463bc3fd28f)
cloning Fusion's Blazorise template was made on Feb 1, 
and I wrote the README describing what's already done
on Feb 10.
